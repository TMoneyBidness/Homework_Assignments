# The Delphia Algorithm: What’s more valuable, User Data or Assets-under-Management?
>**"_You catch more flies with honey….”_**
                    - **Italian Proverb**
## Overview and Origin

Delphia Inc. is a Toronto-based fintech company that utilizes machine learning of proprietary consumer data to create an alpha-generating algorithm in order to achieve two goals: improved market returns for investors, and the ultimate sale of their investor’s data. Delphia pitches their platform as a means for customers to both invest money and submit their real-time data (all financial transactions, socials, email access, stock buys, locations, browsing, etc) to feed their robo advisor algorithm to the shared benefit of all Delphia investors.  

Founded by [Clifton van der Linden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cliffvanderlinden/), [Andrew Peek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cliffvanderlinden/), and [Cameron Westland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camwest/?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAC5114BV5U2so9SgFuEiTVeho61gp-Nt-g) in 2018<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, Delphia (and it’s algorithm) is actually a spin-off company to Clifton’s previous *Vox Pop Labs* venture, founded in 2012. At *Vox*, Clifton pioneered a new way to measure public opinion via big data to create statistical models to predict public opinion and election results. In 2016, Vox accurately predicted Brexit, and a year later began forecasting markets. Delphia was then accepted into the Y Combinator and began it’s funding rounds. Since then, they’ve raised a total of 19.5M in two rounds; Pre-Seed of 4.1M in June 2018, and another 15.4M in December 2019.


## Business Activities

Delphia Inc. isn’t your typical robo advisor. In order to achieve their business objective of creating an accurate and consistent forecasting algorithm, their operational priority is counterintuitive to their competitors; Delphia values user data *over* assets under management. 

Interestingly, there are two sides to Delphia’s mission: their **stated** mission, and their **actual** mission. To recognize this discrepancy, it’s important to first understand the returns that Delphia claims their algorithm can deliver. In fact, it significantly beats standard market metrics of the [S&P return of 18%](https://portfolioslab.com/portfolio/sp-500)<sup>[2](#myfootnote1)</sup> with a sharpe of 1.08 (assumed over 5 years). Delphia offers users the option to invest in one of two algorithms: 

   - **_Collective_**: a long only, globally balanced fund that promise 25% returns, 10% vol,  with a sharpe ratio of 2.48, or

   - **_Flagship_**: a long-only strategy of roughly 200 US Equities (all household names) that promise to return 48%, 22% vol, with a sharpe ratio of 2.24. 


Delphia’s stated mission is to “create meaningful prosperity by redistributing wealth to those whose data is creating economic value.” They claim to fight for the everyman and pose a similar marketing strategy as the popular US trading app, _Robinhood_. In Delphia’s own marketing materials, they reference when Robinhood halted Gamestop trading [($GME)](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/stockdetails/fi-a1tyxm?ocid=ansMSNMoney11&duration=1D) to implore that “the world gets a look at how unfair investing can be.” Delphia’s aim is to attract users by offering customers the altruistic opportunity of competing against Wall St. while earning incredible returns... with the cost of admission being the wholistic turnover of their personal data.

However, the reality of their **actual** mission is much different. Delphia believes the regulatory framework around how companies collect, share, and sell personal data is sunsetting and believe that by 2024, regulators will no longer allow the sharing or sale of 3rd party consumer data from anyone other than those who collected it. As such, the existing marketplaces for data brokers (valued at more than [200B per year](https://financialpost.com/technology/data-brokers-are-tracking-you-and-selling-the-info#:~:text=Digital%20marketing%20company%20WebFX%20estimates,US%24200%20billion%20a%20year.))<sup>[3](#myfootnote1)</sup> will be greatly disrupted as the majority of existing sellers have obtained their data through 3rd parties and will be barred from selling. By 2025, the demand for private data will increase while suppliers of big data will decrease, with market liquidity drastically decreasing. The result will be twofold: competition within algorithmic forecasting space may be adversley impacted, and Delphia may choose to sell their data outright.

Delphia’s target market audience, similar to most robo advisors, are professionals between 30 and 45. However, as internet-savvy Millennials and Gen Z age and thereby increase their deployable savings into long term investments, Delphia must be established and well positioned to capture the market.

Delphia’s current challenge is to acquire enough customers to reach a critical mass of [100,000 users](https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/3668-share-your-data-make)<sup>[4](#myfootnote1)</sup>. To achieve this, they are offering an incredibly competitive offering: 2.5x standard market returns at zero management fees! However, only those who hand over the majority of their personal data can share in the collective returns. 

So how does Delphia’s proprietary algorithm achieve 48% annual returns? Delphia claims to forecast the growth and profitability of thousands of companies through pooled user data utilizing machine learning models. Each day, they run 43 million active predictions, 100k new predictions, 4,500 daily features, and 50Bn data points. These algorithms are typically written in pseudocode then executed by Python, Django, React and SQL.


## Landscape

Delphi shares a grey competitive market space somewhere between robo-advisors (digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services), and traditional [data collection and harvesting apps](https://www.idropnews.com/news/psa-these-apps-are-collecting-and-selling-a-ton-of-your-personal-information/155514/) (ie. Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc).

The robo advising industry is on track to triple in value by 2025. Last year, assets managed by robo-advisors hit 987 billion, with the expectation of reaching [2.9 trillion worldwide by 2025](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp)<sup>[5](#myfootnote1)</sup>. For customer acquisition, Delphia’s major competitors are other robo advisors like Wealthsimple, CIBC Mellon, Ethic, MoneyFarm, FutureAdvisor. However, for the ultimate sale of user data in the near future, Delphia will compete with similar data-harvesting apps via marketplaces like Axciom LLC [(among many other data brokers)](https://www.fastcompany.com/90310803/here-are-the-data-brokers-quietly-buying-and-selling-your-personal-information)<sup>[6](#myfootnote1)</sup>


## Results

The business impact of Delphia within the robo advisor market has been somewhat dormant in the recent year. In fact, there has been only one [official press release](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ai-powered-investment-platform-delphia-launches-new-alternative-investment-newsletter-1030822059) from Delphia in 2021! Regardless, they are still active within the industry as they are currently hiring (8 positions) in addition to their current technical staff of 30, and support staff (likely 8) for a total of ~35 people. They also still carry an office at 501 Queen St. West in Toronto.

Upon Delphia’s next push to acquire users, their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be the following success metrics: total users, accessed and collected data points, AUM (Assets under Management), and portfolio performance. It is very difficult to ascertain how Delphia is stacking up to these metrics without access to more news, website information, or personal connections.

As for annual revenue, acknowlding that their founding team started with 19.5M raised in venture capital (and assuming 5M of private ‘friends and family’ money), it is plausible that their burn rate is at least 5M a year. As such, they must be generating some revenue (or Delphia returns!) on their venture to date.

The falling website traffic supports this theory.

In comparison, WealthSimple (2014) has over 900 employees, offices in Toronto, New York, and London, has over [15B in assets under management](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/about/who-we-are/)<sup>[7](#myfootnote1)</sup>, and 1.5M users.

## Recommendations

Delphia’s management team has a track record of success, and they’ve received faith, funding and guidance from startup giants (including Tobias Lutke, founder of Shopify). However, their recent fade from prominence raises doubt that they can deliver on their promise of a 2.5x alpha return(!) Note that Delphia’s claim of 48% performance returns 7x within five years, and 50x in 10 years. Additionally, their founder Clifton van der Linden has [faced scrutiny](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/whatever-happened-to-vox-pop-labs-600000-canada-150-survey/)<sup>[7](#myfootnote1)</sup>at Vox Pops Labs for receiving public money and not delivering the final product.

In light of the above concerns, my recommendations to improve Delphia’s success is the following:

   - **_Create an Omni-channel Platform_**: Many aspects of the financial advice relationship continue to require human intervention, like customizable advice, estate planning and tax strategies.
   - **_Alternative Market Offerings_**: Delphia should adapt their algorithm to read sentiment of highly speculated and laissez-faire markets ripe for sentiment analysis. They should comprise offerings related to crypto, NFTs, etc. This would attract a large portion of investors who wish to capitalize on these markets but don't know how. It would raise awareness of their platform, attract users, and ultimately 
   - **_Enhanced Marketing Strategy_**: 
       - **_Authentic Branding_**: Put a face to the algorithm, launch a spokesperson-focused campaign, include real testimonials on the site. This builds user trust.
       - **_Potential Name Change_**: Delphia does not inspire any association with money, markets, or independence. It feels exclusive.
       - **_Improved Social Media Engagement_**: Twitter, Facebook, etc. Build buzz and relevance.
   - **_Demonstrate the power of the algorithm_**: As of now, the promise of 48% returns seems too good to be true. Delphia should create content and case studies that prove the true value and power of the platform.

In closing, both Delphia’s management team and mission are promising, but their overall lack of authenticity or demonstrated performance raises cause for concern. Delphia appears to be a wolf in sheep's clothing by misrepresenting their ‘democratizing wealth’ mission as an altruistic means of generating immense returns when, in fact, they are simply hoarding your personal data for the ultimate sale to the highest bidder.
